	<p>Today&rsquo;s Wi-Fi spectrum bands are wildly popular.&nbsp; But with more and more people and devices taking advantage of this technology, these bands are getting congested.&nbsp; It reminds us of the famous Yogi Berra quote, &ldquo;Nobody goes there anymore; it&rsquo;s too crowded.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In response to the growing use of Wi-Fi, the Federal Communications Commission has taken steps to meet the growing demand for additional unlicensed spectrum.&nbsp; Last year, we added 100 megahertz of spectrum for Wi-Fi in the lower 5 GHz band.&nbsp; The Commission is also seeking to secure some unlicensed spectrum opportunities in the 600 MHz band as part of our upcoming incentive auction.&nbsp; But more needs to be done&mdash;and soon.</p>
	<p>One spectrum band that we believe needs greater attention is in the upper 5 GHz band.&nbsp; In light of the proximity to spectrum in other parts of the 5 GHz band that are already used for unlicensed services, this is a prime candidate to help meet the demand for Wi-Fi.&nbsp; Unlicensed services generally share spectrum with other radio services on a non-interference basis.&nbsp; So one of the bands identified for potential new sharing is the 75 megahertz of spectrum located at 5850 to 5925 MHz (also known as the U-NII-4 band) that was allocated by the Commission in 1999 for Dedicated Short Range Communications Service (DSRC) systems intended to improve roadway safety.&nbsp;</p>
